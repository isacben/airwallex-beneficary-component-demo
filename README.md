## Creating a Beneficiary

This demo does not create a beneficiary; it only returns the payload required to create a beneficary based on the options selected with the embedded component.

The produced payload can be used to [create the beneficary](https://github.com/isacben/airwallex-beneficary-component-demo/tree/main/node) or to [create a payout](https://www.airwallex.com/docs/api#/Payouts/Payments/).
